        <h4>Interior Design Concept for Modern New Home</h4>

        <p>A young family bought the newly built house from a property 
            builder. This house is minimal and modern, but its decor 
            was more suitable for periodic houses with high ceilings. 
            The new owners wanted a modern interior design to complement 
            the property's exciting architecture. We replaced the 
            predictable and unpredictable look used by the developers
            with a design that looks contemporary and personal at the 
            same time, tailored to the owners' social lifestyle. 
            Large picture windows in each room overlook the ancient 
            forests, so inviting nature was also important. This house 
            should be a house with a conscious but calm design, 
            which wears its luxury items and finishes slowly.
        </p>

        <h4>About the Modern New Home</h4>
        <p>It has a generous open-plan living area, three bedrooms 
            all with en suite bathrooms, an extra guest bathroom with 
            a hidden shower, and a TV room. It is located in a generous 
            garden on a private development in Golsar, Rasht. 
            It covers an area of 200 square meters with ceilings of 
            2.7 meters and each room has floor-to-ceiling windows. 
            Kebony, a viable alternative to tropical hardwood, has been 
            widely used in construction.
        </p>
        

        <h4>Space Layout in Modern New Home</h4>
        <p>The original layout was correct, but we carefully adjusted 
            some of the details to make the most of the space and make 
            sure the house really suits its owners and their lifestyle. 
            The living room was optimized to create a large living area 
            with a corner sofa and a separate study area. We also 
            designed a modern fireplace with easy-to-use bioethanol 
            fire. The flexible dining area has a table that is suitable 
            for family meals, but when friends and relatives visit it, 
            it can be a party for 10 people. We added a sofa bed to the 
            TV room and turned the dressing room into a guest bathroom. 
            Shower hidden behind a custom glass and iron partition made 
            in Italy. We also redesigned the shower room to make better 
            use of its space and installed a bathtub suitable for 
            children.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h4>The flooring</h4>
        <p>Less luxury, with plenty of heat, texture and natural 
            materials, is at the heart of this home's appearance. 
            That's why we replaced the original gray floor tiles - 
            so cold! - With wide engineered oak boards, on underfloor 
            heating.
        </p>

        <h4>The bathrooms</h4>
        <p>In the guest shower room, black irons point to the window 
            frame of the house. We combined it with Beton Cire, a good 
            type of plaster made in France, on the walls. The other 
            three private bathrooms feature natural wood flooring, 
            toilet units and decorative panels for warmth. In the baby 
            bath, we used Domus handmade red tile tiles for fun. 
            The combination of materials in all bathrooms - concrete, 
            iron, wood and glass - keeps them modern, but also cozy.
        </p>

            <img class="modern-home-img1" src="img/Portfolio/ModernHome/5.jpeg" alt="">
        </div>

        <h4>The walls</h4>
        <p>We continued with a neutral color scheme, but added walls of 
            Philip Jefferson natural fiber wallpaper to create a cozy 
            atmosphere, introduce texture, and connect the outside with 
            the inside.
        </p>

        <h4>The furniture</h4>
        <p>We have thousands of contacts in the world of design and 
            we have searched for them to find the right furniture for 
            this house. We sourced parts and fittings from more than 30 
            different suppliers in 15 countries. The walnut coffee 
            table is made by a Canadian craftsman, while the armchair 
            is made by Italian furniture maker Moroso. For a custom 
            edge, we also covered some of the pieces in a fabric that 
            was specifically chosen to complete the design. For example, 
            a corner sofa from the Scandinavian design team Norr11 is 
            covered with quadrat fabric. In the master bedroom, we 
            changed the clean and modern look by adding side tables 
            from the 1950s by Osvaldo Borsani, found in an old London 
            exhibition. In the study area, we used De La Espada 
            furniture - its exceptional design and quality match the 
            beauty of this house.
        </p>

        <h4>The colour scheme</h4>
        <p>There are natural colors throughout and each room has its 
            own palette. The living room looks to be inspired by autumn,
             with khaki colors, wine accents and black colors tied to 
             the window frames. In the guest bedroom, light blue, 
             salmon and green shades are combined. The baby's bedroom 
             is mostly neutral, but a wall is covered with a large 
             floral pattern to introduce the "wow" factor. Complementing 
             dark rose curtains, to create an unexpected and not 
             childish design. The master bedroom is the most colorful 
             bedroom, with natural brown wood fiber wallpaper along 
             with a bed covered with dark gray fabric. The light 
             mustard color of its tubes comes on the velvet sofa and 
             all the colors are balanced with the pale walls and floors 
             to create an original and at the same time soothing design.

        <h4>The lighting</h4>
        <p>The house receives a lot of light through large windows and 
            floodlights installed throughout, but we have complemented 
            this light with a combination of ceiling, wall and floor 
            lamps that zoning the space and creating a more intimate 
            atmosphere. Beautiful round pendants by Kenneth Cobonpue, 
            handmade in the Philippines, give a dramatic effect to the 
            dining area, while floor lamps by Matthew Hilton are the 
            best color for the study area. Its sleek ghost does not 
            detract from the outstanding artwork of Canadian artist 
            Sandra Lamb, and its slim, pleated shade appears to mirror 
            washed linen curtains in the background.
